# Ray-Tracer
A project using python where the simulations of rays are traced and recorded.

DESCRIPTION OF OUR PROJECT 
Simulation of light rays in the virtual 3D world consisting of different 3D models 
such as Spheres and Triangles with more complex models stored as List of Triangles. 
Through the concept of vectors and vector equations of different 3D models, 
intersections are determined and the material properties at the point of intersection 
are used to determine the further path of the light rays which may have more 
intersections. The final colour of the light rays is stored per pixel of the 
final image in the format of PPM.
